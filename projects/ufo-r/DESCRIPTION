Title: UserFault Objects: framework for implementing of custom objects
       masquerading as plain R objects via user faults
Description: Experiments in making custom objects with complex behavior
             appearing as ordinary R data structures (data.frames, matrices,
             etc.) to both R functions and C functions. This uses user faults
             (memory faults) to capture memory accesses and override them.
