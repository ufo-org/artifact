We claim the following badges for the artifact:
* functional
* reusable
* available

## For authors claiming a functional or reusable badge: What are claims about the artifactâ€™s functionality to be evaluated by the committee?

Functional evaluation of claims:

* The paper claims that programable memory abstractions have performance
  comparable to ALTREP and standard R vectors and outperform ALTREP's dynamic
  dispatch, when accessing individual vector elements. This is shown in Fig. 12.

  We provide the complete recreation of the benchmarks in
  `/experiments/benchmark.Rmd` which re-execute the experiment and re-generate
  graphs used in the paper. The notebook contains full instructions about
  executing the benchmarks. 
  
  The experiment uses `/data/250M_rand_int.bin` as input. The experiment
  compares UFOs implemented by `/projects/ufo-core`, `/projects/ufo-c` ,
  `/projects/ufo-r`, and `/projects/ufo-r-vectors`, ALTREP vectors implemented
  in `/projects/altrep`, and standard R vectors.

* In Fig 3. the paper shows that the memory management implemented within UFOs
  keeps memory usage at a level specified by the high water mark, regardless of
  the collective size of live UFO objects. We show that dirty chunks are backed
  onto a file, contributing to increaing memory usage, and that when no chunks
  are dirtied the disk usage remains constant.

  We provide a complete recreation of the experiment in
  `/experiments/membench.Rmd` which re-execute the experiment and re-generate
  graph from the paper. The notebook contains full instructions for executing
  the experiment.

  The experiment uses the code at `/projects/membench`.

* In addition the paper provides a suite of examples and instructions for
  creating new UFO backends to support the framework's usefullness in problem
  solving and as a tool for library implementers. These can be found in
  `/vignettes/ufo-r-vectors.Rmd` and `/vignettes/ufo-r-programming.Rmd` and use
  data in `/data/` as well as the local postgres instance, database `ufos`.

## For authors claiming a reusable badge: What are the authors' claims about the artifact's reusability to be evaluated by the committee?

Reusability scenarios:

* The benchmarks in `/experiemnts` are parameterized in terms of high and low
  watermarks, specifying how much memory UFOs can use, chunk sizes, and data
  size, allowing to experiment with the performance of various frameworks under
  differing conditions. We also provide scripts to generate additional data
  files and database tables with different sizes and contents.

* The benchmarks in `/experiments/benchmark.Rmd` can be extended by adding
  additional benchmark scenarios (e.g. a random walk, other operators on
  vectors). The benchmarks are executed using the `microbenchmark` package in R
  which makes it easy to modify or add code to execute within the benchmark.

* The benchmarks in `/experiments/benchmark.Rmd` can also be extended by adding
  new UFO and ALTREP backend implementations, or other similar libraries or
  technologies. We provide a guide on creating new UFO backends in
  `/vignettes/ufo-r-programming.Rmd`.

* We provide usage examples for UFO R vectors which can be modified to explore
  their robustness and discover the limitations of the library.

## For authors claiming an available badge

We will publish the artifact on DARTS. In addition, we will plan to make the
source code and scripts for generating data for the artifact on GitHub for
convenience of access.
